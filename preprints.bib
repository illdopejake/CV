abstract = {Tau is one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, and bears a much closer relationship to local neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment than the other hallmark, $\beta$-amyloid. Cell and rodent models have shown evidence that tau spreads from cell to cell through anatomical neuronal connections, and that this process is facilitated by the presence of $\beta$-amyloid. We test this hypothesis in humans by using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate the spread of tau over human neuronal connections, and we compare the simulated pattern of progression to the observed pattern measured in the brains of 312 individuals on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, using PET. Fitting our model, we found that the majority of variance in the overall pattern of tau progression could be explained by diffusion of an agent through the human connectome, measured using either functional connectivity or diffusion tractography. These models far exceeded chance, and outperformed models testing the extracellular spread of tau over Euclidian space. Surprisingly, the ESM predicted the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether subjects demonstrated evidence for brain $\beta$-amyloid. In addition, in $\beta$-amyloid-positive subjects only, regions with greater amyloid burden showed greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of amyloid in accelerating the spread of tau in certain isocortical regions. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain $\beta$-amyloid.},

@article{Vogel2020Hipp,
abstract = {The functional organization of the hippocampus is distributed as a gradient along its longitudinal axis that explains its differential interaction with diverse brain systems. We show that the location of human tissue samples extracted along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus can be predicted within 2mm using the expression pattern of less than 100 genes. When variation in this specific gene expression pattern was observed across the whole brain, a distinct anterioventral-posteriodorsal gradient was observed. Frontal, anterior temporal and brainstem regions involved in social and motivational behaviors, selectively vulnerable to frontotemporal dementia and more functionally connected to the anterior hippocampus could be clearly differentiated from posterior parieto-occipital and cerebellar regions involved in spatial cognition, selectively vulnerable to Alzheimers disease, and more functionally connected to the posterior hippocampus. These findings place the human hippocampus at the interface of two major brain systems defined by a single distinct molecular gradient. },

@article{Binette2019,
abstract = {It remains unclear which grey matter (GM) changes are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and how these changes might differ from normal brain aging. Using independent component analysis of GM maps on a large, multi-cohort dataset, we derived morphometric networks and investigated GM volume in such networks in young, old adulthood, and AD. GM loss in frontal networks was more specific to aging, while it was the result of an additive effect of aging and AD in all other networks. The pattern of GM volume across all morphometric networks changed in aging and AD, but a higher degree of variability in the whole-brain pattern and GM volume characterized AD only. In cognitively normal older adults, having a preserved whole-brain pattern was related to better cognition and lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that higher heterogeneity in GM volume and whole-brain pattern is specific to AD, as opposed to atrophy that changes additively between “normal” aging and AD.},
