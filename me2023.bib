   abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are the most common cause of dementia. Although their underlying molecular pathologies have been identified, there is substantial heterogeneity in the patterns of progressive brain alterations across and within these diseases. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have revealed that pathological proteins accumulate along specific macroscale brain networks, implicating the network architecture of the brain in the system-level pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the extent to which ‘network-based neurodegeneration’ applies across the wide range of neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. Here, we discuss the state-of-the-art of neuroimaging-based connectomics for the mapping and prediction of neurodegenerative processes. We review findings supporting brain networks as passive conduits through which pathological proteins spread. As an alternative view, we also discuss complementary work suggesting that network alterations actively modulate the spreading of pathological proteins between connected brain regions. We conclude this Perspective by proposing an integrative framework in which connectome-based models can be advanced along three dimensions of innovation: incorporating parameters that modulate propagation behaviour on the basis of measurable biological features; building patient-tailored models that use individual-level information and allowing model parameters to interact dynamically over time. We discuss promises and pitfalls of these strategies for improving disease insights and moving towards precision medicine.},

To uncover the molecular basis of human brain connectivity, we analyzed a unique cohort of 98 individuals who provided neuroimaging and genetic data contemporaneous with dendritic spine morphometric, proteomic, and gene expression data from the superior frontal and inferior temporal gyri. Through cellular contextualization of the molecular data with dendritic spine morphology, we identified hundreds of proteins related to synapses, energy metabolism, and RNA processing that explain between-individual differences in functional connectivity and structural covariation. By integrating data at the genetic, molecular, subcellular, and tissue levels, we bridged the divergent fields of molecular biology and neuroimaging to identify a molecular basis of brain connectivity.One-Sentence Summary Dendritic spine morphometry and synaptic proteins unite the divergent fields of molecular biology and neuroimaging.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {6 Amyloid-beta is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in 7 Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is because of the spatial 8 discordance between amyloid-beta, which accumulates in the neocortex, and tau, which 9 accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during aging. There is evidence that in some cases 10 amyloid-beta-independent tau spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with 11 neocortical amyloid-beta. This suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal 12 subtypes of Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic and 13 genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven disease progression 14 subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo PET based measures from two large 15 observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Religious Orders 16 Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. 17 We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional 18 information from both studies. In the amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-beta 19 precedes the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype mild tau 20 accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with amyloid-beta. As 21 expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first subtype among apolipoprotein E 22 (APOE) ε4 allele carriers while the tau-first subtype was more common among APOE ε4 non-23 carriers. Within tau-first APOE ε4 carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-beta 24 accumulation (via longitudinal amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within 25 the Alzheimer's disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE ε4 carriers had several 26 fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable risk factors in 27 facilitating amyloid-beta-independent tau.

	abstract = {Biological staging of individuals with Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) may improve diagnostic and prognostic work-up of dementia in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. Here, we created a staging model using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm by evaluating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau biomarkers in 426 participants from BioFINDER-2, that represent the entire spectrum of AD. The model composition and main analyses were replicated in 222 participants from the Knight ADRC cohort. SuStaIn revealed in the two cohorts that the data was best explained by a single biomarker sequence (one subtype), and that five CSF biomarkers (ordered: Aβ42/40, tau phosphorylation occupancies at the residues 217 and 205 [pT217/T217 and pT205/T205], microtubule-binding region of tau containing the residue 243 [MTBR-tau243], and total tau) were sufficient to create an accurate disease staging model. Increasing CSF stages (0-5) were associated with increased abnormality in other AD-related biomarkers, such as Aβ- and tau-PET, and aligned with different phases of longitudinal biomarker changes consistent with current models of AD progression. Higher CSF stages at baseline were associated with higher hazard ratio of clinical decline. Our findings indicate that a common pathophysiologic molecular pathway develops across all AD patients, and that a single CSF collection is sufficient to reliably indicate the presence of both AD pathologies and the degree and stage of disease progression.Competing Interest StatementOH has acquired research support (for the institution) from ADx, AVID Radiopharmaceuticals, Biogen, Eli Lilly, Eisai, Fujirebio, GE Healthcare, Pfizer, and Roche.

   abstract = {TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) accumulation is the primary pathology underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Charting the progression and heterogeneity of TDP-43 accumulation is necessary to better characterize TDP-43 proteinopathies, but current TDP-43 staging systems are heuristic and assume each syndrome is homogeneous. Here, we use data-driven disease progression modelling to derive a fine-grained empirical staging system for the classification and differentiation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP, n = 126), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 141) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) with and without Alzheimer’s disease (n = 304). The data-driven staging of ALS and FTLD-TDP complement and extend previously described human-defined staging schema for ALS and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In LATE-NC individuals, progression along data-driven stages was positively associated with age, but negatively associated with age in individuals with FTLD-TDP. Using only regional TDP-43 severity, our data driven model distinguished individuals diagnosed with ALS, FTLD-TDP or LATE-NC with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.9%, with misclassifications associated with mixed pathological diagnosis, age and genetic mutations. Adding age and SuStaIn stage to this model increased accuracy to 92.3%. Our model differentiates LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP, though some overlap was observed between late-stage LATE-NC and early-stage FTLD-TDP. We further tested for the presence of subtypes with distinct regional TDP-43 progression patterns within each diagnostic group, identifying two distinct cortical-predominant and brainstem-predominant subtypes within FTLD-TDP and a further two subcortical-predominant and corticolimbic-predominant subtypes within ALS. The FTLD-TDP subtypes exhibited differing proportions of TDP-43 type, while there was a trend for age differing between ALS subtypes. Interestingly, a negative relationship between age and SuStaIn stage was seen in the brainstem/subcortical-predominant subtype of each proteinopathy. No subtypes were observed for the LATE-NC group, despite aggregating individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease and a larger sample size for this group. Overall, we provide an empirical pathological TDP-43 staging system for ALS, FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC, which yielded accurate classification. We further demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity amongst ALS and FTLD-TDP progression patterns that warrants further investigation in larger cross-cohort studies.},

   abstract = {Importance: Longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a relevant outcome in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer disease (AD). A key unanswered question is whether the use of participant-specific (individualized) regions of interest (ROIs) is superior to conventional approaches where the same ROI (group-level) is used for each participant. Objective: To compare group- and participant-level ROIs in participants at different stages of the AD clinical continuum in terms of annual percentage change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and sample size requirements. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a longitudinal cohort study with consecutive participant enrollment between September 18, 2017, and November 15, 2021. Included in the analysis were participants with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Biomarkers For Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably 2 (BioFINDER-2) study; in addition, a validation sample (the AVID 05e, Expedition-3, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and BioFINDER-1 study cohorts) was also included. Exposures: Tau PET (BioFINDER-2, [18F]RO948; validation sample, [18F]flortaucipir), 7 group-level (5 data-driven stages, meta-temporal, whole brain), and 5 individualized ROIs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Annual percentage change in tau-PET SUVR across ROIs. Sample size requirements in simulated clinical trials using tau PET as an outcome were also calculated. Results: A total of 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.4 (7.5) years; 111 male [51.6%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study were included in this analysis: 97 amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 77 with Aβ-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD dementia. In the validation sample were 137 Aβ-positive CU participants, 144 with Aβ-positive MCI, and 125 with AD dementia. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.8 (0.3) years. Using group-level ROIs, the largest annual percentage increase in tau-PET SUVR in Aβ-positive CU individuals was seen in a composite ROI combining the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (4.29%; 95% CI, 3.42%-5.16%). In individuals with Aβ-positive MCI, the greatest change was seen in the temporal cortical regions (5.82%; 95% CI, 4.67%-6.97%), whereas in those with AD dementia, the greatest change was seen in the parietal regions (5.22%; 95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%). Significantly higher estimates of annual percentage change were found using several of the participant-specific ROIs. Importantly, the simplest participant-specific approach, where change in tau PET was calculated in an ROI that best matched the participant's data-driven disease stage, performed best in all 3 subgroups. For the power analysis, sample size reductions for the participant-specific ROIs ranged from 15.94% (95% CI, 8.14%-23.74%) to 72.10% (95% CI, 67.10%-77.20%) compared with the best-performing group-level ROIs. Findings were replicated using [18F]flortaucipir. Conclusions and Relevance: Finding suggest that certain individualized ROIs carry an advantage over group-level ROIs for assessing longitudinal tau changes and increase the power to detect treatment effects in AD clinical trials using longitudinal tau PET as an outcome.},

However, CSF biomarker concentrations may be influenced by non-disease related mechanisms which vary between individuals, such as CSF production and clearance rates. Here we use a data-driven approach to demonstrate the existence of inter-individual variability in mean CSF protein levels. We show that these non-disease related differences cause many commonly reported CSF biomarkers to be highly correlated, thereby producing misleading results if not accounted for. To adjust for this inter-individual variability, we identified and evaluated high-performing reference proteins which improved the diagnostic accuracy of key CSF AD biomarkers. Our novel reference protein method attenuates the risk for false positive findings, and improves the sensitivity and specificity of CSF biomarkers, with broad implications for both research and clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Importance: There is currently no consensus as to which biomarkers best predict longitudinal tau accumulation at different clinical stages of Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To describe longitudinal [18F]RO948 tau positron emission tomography (PET) findings across the clinical continuum of AD and determine which biomarker combinations showed the strongest associations with longitudinal tau PET and best optimized clinical trial enrichment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study consecutively enrolled amyloid-β (Aβ)-negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, Aβ-positive CU individuals, Aβ-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with AD dementia between September 2017 and November 2020 from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 (discovery cohort) and BioFINDER-1 (validation cohort) studies. Exposures: Baseline plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42/Aβ40, tau phosphorylated at threonine-217 (p-tau217), p-tau181 and neurofilament light, magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid PET ([18F]flutemetamol), and tau PET ([18F]RO948 in the BioFINDER-2 study; [18F]flortaucipir in the BioFINDER-1 study). Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline tau PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and annual percent change in tau PET SUVR across regions of interest derived using a data-driven approach combining clustering and event-based modeling. Regression models were used to examine associations between individual biomarkers and longitudinal tau PET and to identify which combinations best predicted longitudinal tau PET. These combinations were then entered in a power analysis to examine how their use as an enrichment strategy would affect sample size in a simulated clinical trial. Results: Of 343 participants, the mean (SD) age was 72.56 (7.24) years, and 157 (51.1%) were female. The clustering/event-based modeling-based approach identified 5 regions of interest (stages). In Aβ-positive CU individuals, the largest annual increase in tau PET SUVR was seen in stage I (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala; 4.04% [95% CI, 2.67%-5.32%]). In Aβ-positive individuals with MCI and with AD dementia, the greatest increases were seen in stages II (temporal cortical regions; 4.45% [95% CI, 3.41%-5.49%]) and IV (certain frontal regions; 5.22% [95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%]), respectively. In Aβ-negative CU individuals and those with MCI, modest change was seen in stage I (1.38% [95% CI, 0.78%-1.99%] and 1.80% [95% CI, 0.76%-2.84%], respectively). When looking at individual predictors and longitudinal tau PET in the stages that showed most change, plasma p-tau217 (R2= 0.27, P <.005), tau PET (stage I baseline SUVR; R2= 0.13, P <.05) and amyloid PET (R2= 0.10, P <.05) were significantly associated with longitudinal tau PET in stage I in Aβ-positive CU individuals. In Aβ-positive individuals with MCI, plasma p-tau217 (R2= 0.24, P <.005) and tau PET (stage II baseline SUVR; R2= 0.44, P <.001) were significantly associated with longitudinal tau PET in stage II. Findings were replicated in BioFINDER-1 using longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir. For the power analysis component, plasma p-tau217 with tau PET resulted in sample size reductions of 43% (95% CI, 34%-46%; P <.005) in Aβ-positive CU individuals and of 68% (95% CI, 61%-73%; P <.001) in Aβ-positive individuals with MCI. Conclusions and Relevance: In trials using tau PET as the outcome, plasma p-tau217 with tau PET may prove optimal for enrichment in preclinical and prodromal AD. However, plasma p-tau217 was most important in preclinical AD, while tau PET was more important in prodromal AD..},

               cognitively impaired compared to both A$\beta$-negative and
               A$\beta$-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals. In
               participants along the AD spectrum, GM-CBF was associated with
               tau, synaptic and axonal dysfunction, but not A$\beta$ in
               similar cortical regions. Axonal degeneration was further
               associated with hypoperfusion in cognitively unimpaired
               individuals. Disease progression modeling revealed that GM-CBF
               disruption Followed the abnormality of biomarkers of A$\beta$,
               tau and brain atrophy. These findings indicate that tau tangles
               and neurodegeneration are more closely connected with GM-CBF
               changes than A$\beta$ pathology. Although subjected to the
               sensitivity of the employed neuroimaging techniques and the
               modeling approach, these findings suggest that hypoperfusion
               might not be an early event associated with the build-up of

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The spatial layout of large-scale functional brain
               networks differs between individuals and is particularly
               variable in the association cortex, implicated in a broad range
               of psychiatric disorders. However, it remains unknown whether
               this variation in functional topography is related to major
               dimensions of psychopathology in youth. METHODS: The authors
               studied 790 youths ages 8 to 23 years who had 27 minutes of
               high-quality functional magnetic resonance imaging data as part
               of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Four correlated
               dimensions were estimated using a confirmatory correlated traits
               factor analysis on 112 item-level clinical symptoms, and one
               overall psychopathology factor with 4 orthogonal dimensions were
               extracted using a confirmatory factor analysis. Spatially
               regularized nonnegative matrix factorization was used to
               identify 17 individual-specific functional networks for each
               participant. Partial least square regression with split-half
               cross-validation was conducted to evaluate to what extent the
               topography of personalized functional networks encodes major
               dimensions of psychopathology. RESULTS: Personalized functional
               network topography significantly predicted unseen individuals'
               major dimensions of psychopathology, including fear, psychosis,
               externalizing, and anxious-misery. Reduced representation of
               association networks was among the most important features for
               the prediction of all 4 dimensions. Further analysis revealed
               that personalized functional network topography predicted
               overall psychopathology (r = 0.16, permutation testing p <
               .001), which drove prediction of the 4 correlated dimensions.
               CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individual differences
               in functional network topography in association networks is
               related to overall psychopathology in youth. Such results

               complications such as diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.
               Recently, excess weight has also been related to brain atrophy
               and cognitive decline. Reports show that obesity is linked with
               Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related changes, such as
               cerebrovascular damage or amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation. However,
               to date no research has conducted a direct comparison between
               brain atrophy patterns in AD and obesity. OBJECTIVE: Here, we
               compared patterns of brain atrophy and amyloid-$\beta$/tau
               protein accumulation in obesity and AD using a sample of over
               1,300 individuals from four groups: AD patients, healthy
               controls, obese otherwise healthy individuals, and lean
               individuals. METHODS: We age- and sex-matched all groups to the
               AD-patients group and created cortical thickness maps of AD and
               obesity. This was done by comparing AD patients with healthy
               controls, and obese individuals with lean individuals. We then
               compared the AD and obesity maps using correlation analyses and
               permutation-based tests that account for spatial
               autocorrelation. Similarly, we compared obesity and AD brain
               maps with amyloid-$\beta$ and tau protein maps from other
               studies. RESULTS: Obesity maps were highly correlated with AD
               maps but were not correlated with amyloid-$\beta$/tau protein
               maps. This effect was not accounted for by the presence of
               obesity in the AD group. CONCLUSION: Our research confirms that
               obesity-related grey matter atrophy resembles that of AD. Excess
               weight management could lead to improved health outcomes, slow
               down cognitive decline in aging, and lower the risk for AD.",

abstract = {Amyloid-beta deposition is one of the hallmark pathologies in both sporadic Alzheimer's disease and autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, the latter of which is caused by mutations in genes involved in amyloid-beta processing. Despite amyloid-beta deposition being a centrepiece to both sporadic Alzheimer's disease and autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, some differences between these Alzheimer's disease subtypes have been observed with respect to the spatial pattern of amyloid-beta. Previous work has shown that the spatial pattern of amyloid-beta in individuals spanning the sporadic Alzheimer's disease spectrum can be reproduced with high accuracy using an epidemic spreading model which simulates the diffusion of amyloid-beta across neuronal connections and is constrained by individual rates of amyloid-beta production and clearance. However, it has not been investigated whether amyloid-beta deposition in the rarer autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease can be modelled in the same way, and if so, how congruent the spreading patterns of amyloid-beta across sporadic Alzheimer's disease and autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease are. We leverage the epidemic spreading model as a data-driven approach to probe individual-level variation in the spreading patterns of amyloid-beta across three different large-scale imaging datasets (2 sporadic Alzheimer's disease, 1 autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease). We applied the epidemic spreading model separately to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging initiative (n = 737), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (n = 510) and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (n = 249), the latter two of which were processed using an identical pipeline. We assessed inter- and intra-individual model performance in each dataset separately and further identified the most likely subject-specific epicentre of amyloid-beta spread. Using epicentres defined in previous work in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the epidemic spreading model provided moderate prediction of the regional pattern of amyloid-beta deposition across all three datasets. We further find that, whilst the most likely epicentre for most amyloid-beta–positive subjects overlaps with the default mode network, 13% of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease individuals were best characterized by a striatal origin of amyloid-beta spread. These subjects were also distinguished by being younger than autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease subjects with a default mode network amyloid-beta origin, despite having a similar estimated age of symptom onset. Together, our results suggest that most autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease patients express amyloid-beta spreading patterns similar to those of sporadic Alzheimer's disease, but that there may be a subset of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease patients with a separate, striatal phenotype.},

abstract = { Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight 1 . Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data ( http://www.brainchart.io/ ). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories 2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones 3 , showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes. },

abstract = {Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that uniquely enables the identification of subgroups of individuals with distinct pseudo-temporal disease progression patterns from cross-sectional datasets. SuStaIn has been used to identify data-driven subgroups and perform patient stratification in neurodegenerative diseases and in lung diseases from continuous biomarker measurements predominantly obtained from imaging. However, the SuStaIn algorithm is not currently applicable to discrete ordinal data, such as visual ratings of images, neuropathological ratings, and clinical and neuropsychological test scores, restricting the applicability of SuStaIn to a narrower range of settings. Here we propose ‘Ordinal SuStaIn', an ordinal version of the SuStaIn algorithm that uses a scored events model of disease progression to enable the application of SuStaIn to ordinal data. We demonstrate the validity of Ordinal SuStaIn by benchmarking the performance of the algorithm on simulated data. We further demonstrate that Ordinal SuStaIn out-performs the existing continuous version of SuStaIn (Z-score SuStaIn) on discrete scored data, providing much more accurate subtype progression patterns, better subtyping and staging of individuals, and accurate uncertainty estimates. We then apply Ordinal SuStaIn to six different sub-scales of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) using data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study to identify individuals with distinct patterns of functional decline. Using data from 819 ADNI1 participants we identified three distinct CDR subtype progression patterns, which were independently verified using data from 790 ADNI2 participants. Our results provide insight into patterns of decline in daily activities in Alzheimer's disease and a mechanism for stratifying individuals into groups with difficulties in different domains. Ordinal SuStaIn is broadly applicable across different types of ratings data, including visual ratings from imaging, neuropathological ratings and clinical or behavioural ratings data.},

The mediation effect of subcortical structure on the association of PiB or lacunes with cognitive function was analyzed using mixed effects models.  Results: Volume changes in the amygdala and hippocampus partially mediated the effect of PiB changes on memory function (direct effect = −0.168/−0.175, indirect effect = −0.081/−0.077 for amygdala/hippocampus) and completely mediated the effect of PiB changes on clinical dementia rating scale sum of the box (CDR-SOB) (indirect effect = 0.082/0.116 for amygdala/hippocampus). Volume changes in the thalamus completely mediated the effect of lacune on memory, frontal executive functions, and CDR-SOB (indirect effect = −0.037, −0.056, and 0.047, respectively).  Conclusions: Our findings provide a better understanding of the distinct role of subcortical structures in the mediation of the relationships of amyloid or vascular changes with a decline in specific cognitive domains. },

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the spread of tau pathology throughout the cerebral cortex. This spreading pattern was thought to be fairly consistent across individuals, although recent work has demonstrated substantial variability in the population with AD. Using tau-positron emission tomography scans from 1,612 individuals, we identified 4 distinct spatiotemporal trajectories of tau pathology, ranging in prevalence from 18 to 33%. We replicated previously described limbic-predominant and medial temporal lobe-sparing patterns, while also discovering posterior and lateral temporal patterns resembling atypical clinical variants of AD. These 'subtypes' were stable during longitudinal follow-up and were replicated in a separate sample using a different radiotracer. The subtypes presented with distinct demographic and cognitive profiles and differing longitudinal outcomes. Additionally, network diffusion models implied that pathology originates and spreads through distinct corticolimbic networks in the different subtypes. Together, our results suggest that variation in tau pathology is common and systematic, perhaps warranting a re-examination of the notion of 'typical AD' and a revisiting of tau pathological staging.},

Here, we assessed the replicability and reliability of two connectome-generating methods, voxel- or surface-based, using test-retest analyses, fingerprinting and age prediction. The two connectomic methods are initiated by the same state-of-the-art dMRI processing pipeline before diverging at the tractography and connectome-generating steps using either voxels or surfaces. While both methods performed very well across all analyses, voxel-based connectomes performed marginally better than surface-based connectomes. Notably, structural connectomes derived from either method demonstrate reliably accurate representations of both individuals and their chronological age, comparable to similar analyses employing multi-modal features. The difference in methodological performance could be attributed to a number of method-specific features but ultimately show that cutting-edge tractography with robust dMRI processing produces reliable white matter connectivity measures.},

The resulting coordinated activity among neuronal populations supports complex psychological processes, yet how gene expression shapes cognition and emotion remains unknown. Here, we directly bridge the microscale and macroscale by mapping gene expression patterns to functional activation patterns across the cortical sheet. Applying unsupervised learning to the Allen Human Brain Atlas and Neurosynth databases, we identify a ventromedial–dorsolateral gradient of gene assemblies that separate affective and perceptual domains. This topographic molecular-psychological signature reflects the hierarchical organization of the neocortex, including systematic variations in cell type, myeloarchitecture, laminar differentiation and intrinsic network affiliation. In addition, this molecular-psychological signature strengthens over neurodevelopment and can be replicated in two independent repositories. Collectively, our results reveal spatially covarying transcriptomic and cognitive architectures, highlighting the influence that molecular mechanisms exert on psychological processes.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, evidence is lacking regarding longitudinal changes in functional connectivity. This study includes 247 cognitively unimpaired individuals with a family history of sporadic AD (185 women/ 62 men; mean [SD] age of 63 [5.3] years). Plasma total-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline. Global (whole-brain) brain functional connectivity and connectivity from canonical functional networks were computed from resting-state functional MRI obtained at baseline and $\sim$3.5 years of annual follow-ups, using a predefined functional parcellation. A subsample underwent A$\beta$- and tau-PET (n=91). Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that global functional connectivity increased over time across the entire sample. In contrast, higher total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with greater reduction of functional connectivity in the default-mode network over time. In addition, higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with global functional connectivity reduction. The associations were similar when the analyses were repeated using two other functional brain parcellations. A$\beta$ and tau deposition in the brain were not associated with changes in functional connectivity over time in the subsample. These findings provide evidence that vascular burden is associated with a decrease in functional connectivity over time in older adults with elevated risk for AD. Future studies are needed to determine if the impact of vascular risk factors on functional brain changes precede the impact of AD pathology on functional brain changes.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease, postmortem studies have shown that the first cortical site where neurofibrillary tangles appear is the transentorhinal region, a subregion within the medial temporal lobe that largely overlaps with area 35, and the entorhinal cortex. Here we used tau-PET imaging to investigate the sequence of tau pathology progression within the human medial temporal lobe and across regions in the posterior-medial system. Our objective was to study how medial temporal tau is related to functional connectivity, regional atrophy, and memory performance. We included 215 $\beta$-amyloid negative cognitively unimpaired, 81 $\beta$-amyloid positive cognitively unimpaired and 87 $\beta$-amyloid positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment, who each underwent [18]F-RO948 tau and [18]F-flutemetamol amyloid PET imaging, structural T1-MRI and memory assessments as part of the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. First, event-based modelling revealed that the entorhinal cortex and area 35 show the earliest signs of tau accumulation followed by the anterior and posterior hippocampus, area 36 and the parahippocampal cortex. In later stages, tau accumulation became abnormal in neocortical temporal and finally parietal brain regions. Second, in cognitively unimpaired individuals, increased tau load was related to local atrophy in the entorhinal cortex, area 35 and the anterior hippocampus and tau load in several anterior medial temporal lobe subregions was associated with distant atrophy of the posterior hippocampus. Tau load, but not atrophy, in these regions was associated with lower memory performance. Further, tau-related reductions in functional connectivity in critical networks between the medial temporal lobe and regions in the posterior-medial system were associated with this early memory impairment. Finally, in patients with mild cognitive impairment, the association of tau load in the hippocampus with memory performance was partially mediated by posterior hippocampal atrophy. In summary, our findings highlight the progression of tau pathology across medial temporal lobe subregions and its disease-stage specific association with memory performance. While tau pathology might affect memory performance in cognitively unimpaired individuals via reduced functional connectivity in critical medial temporal lobe-cortical networks, memory impairment in mild cognitively impaired patients is associated with posterior hippocampal atrophy.},

abstract = {Tau is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and animal models have suggested that tau spreads from cell to cell through neuronal connections, facilitated by $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$). We test this hypothesis in humans using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate tau spread, and compare these simulations to observed patterns measured using tau-PET in 312 individuals along Alzheimer's disease continuum. Up to 70{\%} of the variance in the overall spatial pattern of tau can be explained by our model. Surprisingly, the ESM predicts the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether brain A$\beta$ is present, but regions with greater A$\beta$ burden show greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of A$\beta$ in accelerating tau spread. Altogether, our results provide evidence in humans that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain A$\beta$.},

abstract = {Age being the main risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, it is particularly challenging to disentangle structural changes related to normal brain ageing from those specific to Alzheimer's disease. Most studies aiming to make this distinction focused on older adults only and on a priori anatomical regions. Drawing on a large, multi-cohort dataset ranging from young adults (n = 468; age range 18–35 years), to older adults with intact cognition (n = 431; age range 55–90 years) and with Alzheimer's disease (n = 50 with late mild cognitive impairment and 71 with Alzheimer's dementia, age range 56–88 years), we investigated grey matter organization and volume differences in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Using independent component analysis on all participants' structural MRI, we first derived morphometric networks and extracted grey matter volume in each network. We also derived a measure of whole-brain grey matter pattern organization by correlating grey matter volume in all networks across all participants from the same cohort. We used logistic regressions and receiver operating characteristic analyses to evaluate how well grey matter volume in each network and whole-brain pattern could discriminate between ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Because increased heterogeneity is often reported as one of the main features characterizing brain ageing, we also evaluated interindividual heterogeneity within morphometric networks and across the whole-brain organization in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, to investigate the clinical validity of the different grey matter features, we evaluated whether grey matter volume or whole-brain pattern was related to clinical progression in cognitively normal older adults. Ageing and Alzheimer's disease contributed additive effects on grey matter volume in nearly all networks, except frontal lobe networks, where differences in grey matter were more specific to ageing. While no networks specifically discriminated Alzheimer's disease from ageing, heterogeneity in grey matter volumes across morphometric networks and in the whole-brain grey matter pattern characterized individuals with cognitive impairments. Preservation of the whole-brain grey matter pattern was also related to lower risk of developing cognitive impairment, more so than grey matter volume. These results suggest both ageing and Alzheimer's disease involve widespread atrophy, but that the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease is uniquely associated with disruption of morphometric organization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is generally considered to be a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, patients with aMCI show heterogeneous patterns of progression. Moreover, there are few studies investigating data-driven cognitive trajectory in aMCI. We therefore classified patients with aMCI based on their cognitive trajectory, measured by clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SOB). Then, we compared the clinical and neuroimaging features among groups classified by cognitive trajectory. METHODS We retrospectively recruited 278 patients with aMCI who underwent three or more timepoints of neuropsychological testing. They also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including structured three-dimensional volume images. Cortical thickness was measured using surface-based methods. We performed trajectory analyses to classify our aMCI patients according to their progression and investigate their cognitive trajectory using CDR-SOB. RESULTS Trajectory analyses showed that patients with aMCI were divided into three groups: stable (61.8{\%}), slow decliner (31.7{\%}), and fast decliner (6.5{\%}). Changes throughout a mean follow-up duration of 3.7 years in the CDR-SOB for the subgroups of stable/slow/fast decliners were 1.3-, 6.4-, and 12-point increases, respectively. Decliners were older and carried apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotypes more frequently than stable patients. Compared with the stable group, decliners showed a higher frequency of aMCI patients with both visual and verbal memory dysfunction, late stage aMCI, and multiple domain dysfunction. In addition, compared with the stable group, the slow decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral parietotemporal areas, while the fast decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral frontotemporal areas. Both decliner groups showed worse cognitive function in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal/executive domains than the stable group. CONCLUSIONS Our data-driven trajectory analysis provides new insights into heterogeneous cognitive trajectories of aMCI and further suggests that baseline clinical and neuroimaging profiles might predict aMCI patients with poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Objective: Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have quantified filamentous tau pathology using regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on observations of the topographical distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem tissue. However, such approaches may not take full advantage of information contained in neuroimaging data. The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these patterns to previously published "pathology-driven" ROIs. Method: Tau-PET patterns were identified from a discovery sample comprised of 123 normal controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Swedish BioFINDER cohort, who underwent [18F]AV1451 PET scanning. Associations with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. BioFINDER [18F]AV1451 images were entered into a voxelwise clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven, clusters and 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, adjusting for age, sex and education. Results: Significant relationships emerged only in two ROIs, both of which were data-driven. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of three ROIs (two data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 25{\%} of variance in MMSE scores. These results generalized to other tests of global cognition. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that hypothesis-free, data-derived ROIs may offer enhanced clinical utility compared to theory-driven ROIs, by utilizing information specific to tau-PET signal.},

We aimed to compare the longitudinal outcome of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients with significant Pittsburgh Compound B uptake [PiB(+) aMCI] and those without [PiB(-) aMCI]. Cerebral $\beta$-amyloid was measured in 47 patients with aMCI using PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) (31 PiB(+) aMCI and 16 PiB(-) aMCI). Clinical (N = 47) and neuropsychological follow-up (N = 37), and follow-up with brain magnetic resonance imaging (N = 38) and PiB-PET (N = 30) were performed for three years. PiB(+) aMCI had a higher risk of progression to dementia (hazard ratio = 3.74, 95{\%} CI = 1.21-11.58) and faster rate of cortical thinning in the bilateral precuneus and right medial and lateral temporal cortices compared to PiB(-) aMCI. Among six PiB(-) aMCI patients who had regional PiB uptake ratio {\textgreater}1.5 in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), three (50.0{\%}) progressed to dementia, and two of them had global PiB uptake ratio {\textgreater}1.5 at the follow-up PiB-PET. Our findings suggest that amyloid imaging is important for predicting the prognosis of aMCI patients, and that it is necessary to pay more attention to PiB(-) aMCI with increased regional PiB uptake in the PCC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Brain reserve is a concept introduced to explain why Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with a greater brain volume prior to onset of pathology generally have better clinical outcomes. In this review, we provide a historical background of the emergence of brain reserve and discuss several aspects that need further clarification, including the dynamic or static nature of the concept and its underlying mechanisms and clinical effect. We then describe how brain reserve has been operationalized over the years, and critically evaluate the use of intracranial volume (ICV) as the most widely used proxy for brain reserve. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis showing that ICV is associated with higher cognitive performance after adjusting for the presence and amount of pathology. Although we acknowledge its imperfections, we conclude that the use of ICV as a proxy for brain reserve is currently warranted. However, further development of more optimal measures of brain reserve as well as a more clearly defined theoretical framework is essential.},

See Tijms and Visser (doi:10.1093/brain/awy113) for a scientific commentary on this article. Alzheimer's disease is preceded by a lengthy 'preclinical' stage spanning many years, during which subtle brain changes occur in the absence of overt cognitive symptoms. Predicting when the onset of disease symptoms will occur is an unsolved challenge in individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In individuals with autosomal dominant genetic Alzheimer's disease, the age of symptom onset is similar across generations, allowing the prediction of individual onset times with some accuracy. We extend this concept to persons with a parental history of sporadic Alzheimer's disease to test whether an individual's symptom onset age can be informed by the onset age of their affected parent, and whether this estimated onset age can be predicted using only MRI. Structural and functional MRIs were acquired from 255 ageing cognitively healthy subjects with a parental history of sporadic Alzheimer's disease from the PREVENT-AD cohort. Years to estimated symptom onset was calculated as participant age minus age of parental symptom onset. Grey matter volume was extracted from T 1 -weighted images and whole-brain resting state functional connectivity was evaluated using degree count. Both modalities were summarized using a 444-region cortical-subcortical atlas. The entire sample was divided into training (n = 138) and testing (n = 68) sets. Within the training set, individuals closer to or beyond their parent's symptom onset demonstrated reduced grey matter volume and altered functional connectivity, specifically in regions known to be vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning was used to identify a weighted set of imaging features trained to predict years to estimated symptom onset. This feature set alone significantly predicted years to estimated symptom onset in the unseen testing data. This model, using only neuroimaging features, significantly outperformed a similar model instead trained with cognitive, genetic, imaging and demographic features used in a traditional clinical setting. We next tested if these brain properties could be generalized to predict time to clinical progression in a subgroup of 26 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, who eventually converted either to mild cognitive impairment or to Alzheimer's dementia. The feature set trained on years to estimated symptom onset in the PREVENT-AD predicted variance in time to clinical conversion in this separate longitudinal dataset. Adjusting for participant age did not impact any of the results. These findings demonstrate that years to estimated symptom onset or similar measures can be predicted from brain features and may help estimate presymptomatic disease progression in at-risk individuals.},

Presymptomatic individuals might be the best candidates for clinical trials, but their identification is challenging because they have no symptoms. OBJECTIVE To assess whether a sporadic parental estimated years to symptom onset calculation could be used to identify information about amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) levels in asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of AD dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed A$\beta$1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 101 cognitively normal individuals who had a lumbar puncture as part of the Presymptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD) cohort from September 1, 2011, through November 30, 2016 (374 participants were enrolled in the cohort during this period). The study estimated each participant's proximity to his/her parent's symptom onset by subtracting the index relative's onset age from his/her current age. The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and A$\beta$ levels was then assessed using apolipoprotein E ϵ4 (APOE4) status and sex as interactive terms. These analyses were performed again in 2 independent cohorts using CSF and Pittsburgh compound B carbon 11-labeled positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) A$\beta$ biomarkers: the Adult Children Study (ACS) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention (WRAP) cohorts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and A$\beta$ burden in asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD. RESULTS The present analysis included a subset of 101 PREVENT-AD individuals (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [5.1] years; 30 [29.7{\%}] male), 128 ACS participants (112 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 63.4 [5.1] years; 31 [27.7{\%}] male; and 107 underwent PIB-PET: mean [SD] age, 64.6 [5.3] years; 27 [25.2{\%}] male), and 135 WRAP participants (85 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 59.9 [6.0] years; 27 [31.8{\%}] male; and 135 underwent PIB-PET: mean [SD] age, 59.6 [6.1] years; 43 [31.9{\%}] male). In the PREVENT-AD cohort, individuals approaching their parent's onset age had lower CSF A$\beta$1-42 levels (range, 402-1597; B = -9.09, P = .04). This association was stronger in APOE4 carriers (B = -17.9, P = .03) and women (B = -19.8, P = .02). In the ACS cohort, the main association was replicated using PIB-PET data, and the sex interaction was replicated using CSF and PIB-PET data. In the WRAP cohort, the results were not replicated using cross-sectional data, but the main association and the APOE interaction were replicated using PIB-PET longitudinal data. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that proximity to parental symptom onsetmay help estimate A$\beta$ biomarker changes in women or APOE4 carrier asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess in a longitudinal study whether subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) contribute unique information to cognitive decline., METHODS: One hundred thirty-six healthy elderly from the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study were followed up for a mean of 4 years. SCD and affective measures were generated from the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) with factor analysis on data from a larger set of 347 healthy, nondepressed (GDS {\textless}11) elderly individuals. Cognition was summarized with previously validated factor scores. Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET scans were acquired to determine the presence (PiB+) or absence (PiB-) of Abeta pathology. Mixed models were used to assess the independent and interactive effects of SCD, affective features, PiB status, and time on cognition, with adjustment for demographic variables., RESULTS: SCD score demonstrated good construct validity compared to an existing measure of subjective memory and was partially explained by several lower-order measurements. Mixed models revealed that SCD interacted with PiB status to predict change in episodic memory and global cognition over time, with adjustment for affective features. PiB+ individuals with more severe SCD demonstrated the steepest cognitive decline. Worse SCD predicted faster decline in working memory independently of PiB status. No such effects were seen for affective scores when adjusted for SCD., CONCLUSIONS: PiB+ individuals with SCD are at greatest risk of cognitive decline. Evidence for amyloid alone is not sufficient to indicate risk of rapid cognitive decline in healthy elderly. Effects of GDS on cognitive decline in nondepressed cohorts may be driven by SCD rather than subsyndromal depression.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 the authors. Aging is accompanied by profound changes in the brain's dopamine system that affect cognitive function. Evidence of powerful individual differences in cognitive aging has sharpened focus on identifying biological factors underlying relative preservation versus vulnerability to decline. Dopamine represents a key target in these efforts. Alterations of dopamine receptors and dopamine synthesis are seen in aging, with receptors generally showing reduction and synthesis demonstrating increases. Using the PET tracer 6-[ 18F]fluoro-L-mtyrosine, we found strong support for upregulated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in healthy older adult humans free of amyloid pathology, relative to young people. We next used fMRI to define the functional impact of elevated synthesis capacity on cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function. We found clear evidence in young adults that low levels of synthesis capacity were suboptimal, associated with diminished cognitive flexibility and altered frontoparietal activation relative to young adults with highest synthesis values. Critically, these relationships between dopamine, performance, and activation were transformed in older adults with higher synthesis capacity. Variability in synthesis capacity was related to intrinsic frontoparietal functional connectivity across groups, suggesting that striatal dopamine synthesis influences the tuning of networks underlying cognitive flexibility. Together, these findings define striatal dopamine's association with cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings in young adults, and reveal the alteration in dopamine-related neural processes in aging.},

abstract = {Single lifestyle factors affect brain biomarkers and cognition. Here, we addressed the covariance of various lifestyle elements and investigated their impact on positron emission tomography-based $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$), hippocampal volume, and cognitive function in aged controls. Lower A$\beta$ burden was associated with a lifestyle comprising high cognitive engagement and low vascular risk, particularly in apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 carriers. Although cognitive function was related to high lifetime cognitive engagement and low vascular risk, A$\beta$ load had no relation to current cognitive function. The covariance between high adult socioeconomic status, high education, and low smoking prevalence predicted better cognitive function and this was mediated by larger hippocampal volume. Our data show that lifestyle is a complex construct composed of associated variables, some of which reflect factors operating over the life span and others which may be developmental. These factors affect brain health via different pathways, which may reinforce one another. Our findings moreover support the importance of an intellectually enriched lifestyle accompanied by vascular health on both cognition and presumed cerebral mediators of cognitive function.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Author 2014. Beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) deposition is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is also present in some cognitively normal elderly adults and may represent a preclinical disease state. While AD patients exhibit disrupted functional connectivity (FC) both within and between resting-state networks, studies of preclinical cases have focused primarily on the default mode network (DMN). The extent to which A$\beta$-related effects occur outside of the DMN and between networks remains unclear. In the present study, we examine how within- and between-network FC are related to both global and regional A$\beta$ deposition as measured by [11C]PIB-PET in 92 cognitively normal older people. We found that within-network FC changes occurred in multiple networks, including the DMN. Changes of between-network FC were also apparent, suggesting that regions maintaining connections to multiple networks may be particularly susceptible to A$\beta$-induced alterations. Cortical regions showing altered FC clustered in parietal and temporal cortex, areas known to be susceptible to AD pathology. These results likely represent a mix of local network disruption, compensatory reorganization, and impaired control network function. They indicate the presence of A$\beta$-related dysfunction of neural systems in cognitively normal people well before these areas become hypometabolic with the onset of cognitive decline.},

abstract = {The advent of the positron emission tomography tracer (18)F-AV1451 provides the unique opportunity to visualize the regional distribution of tau pathology in the living human brain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that tau pathology is closely linked to symptomatology and patterns of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease, in contrast to the more diffuse distribution of amyloid-$\beta$ pathology. We included 20 patients meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, presenting with a variety of clinical phenotypes, and 15 amyloid-$\beta$-negative cognitively normal individuals, who underwent (18)F-AV1451 (tau), (11)C-PiB (amyloid-$\beta$) and (18)F-FDG (glucose metabolism) positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Voxel-wise contrasts against controls (at P {\textless} 0.05 family-wise error corrected) showed that (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG patterns in patients with posterior cortical atrophy ('visual variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 7) specifically targeted the clinically affected posterior brain regions, while (11)C-PiB bound diffusely throughout the neocortex. Patients with an amnestic-predominant presentation (n = 5) showed highest (18)F-AV1451 retention in medial temporal and lateral temporoparietal regions. Patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia ('language variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 5) demonstrated asymmetric left greater than right hemisphere (18)F-AV1451 uptake in three of five patients. Across 30 FreeSurfer-defined regions of interest in 16 Alzheimer's disease patients with all three positron emission tomography scans available, there was a strong negative association between (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG uptake (Pearson's r = -0.49 ± 0.07, P {\textless} 0.001) and less pronounced positive associations between (11)C-PiB and (18)F-FDG (Pearson's r = 0.16 ± 0.09, P {\textless} 0.001) and (18)F-AV1451 and (11)C-PiB (Pearson's r = 0.18 ± 0.09, P {\textless} 0.001). Voxel-wise linear regressions thresholded at P {\textless} 0.05 (uncorrected) showed that, across all patients, younger age was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in wide regions of the neocortex, while older age was associated with increased (18)F-AV1451 in the medial temporal lobe. APOE ϵ4 carriers showed greater temporal and parietal (18)F-AV1451 uptake than non-carriers. Finally, worse performance on domain-specific neuropsychological tests was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in key regions implicated in memory (medial temporal lobes), visuospatial function (occipital, right temporoparietal cortex) and language (left {\textgreater} right temporoparietal cortex). In conclusion, tau imaging-contrary to amyloid-$\beta$ imaging-shows a strong regional association with clinical and anatomical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. Although preliminary, these results are consistent with and expand upon findings from post-mortem, animal and cerebrospinal fluid studies, and suggest that the pathological aggregation of tau is closely linked to patterns of neurodegeneration and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.},

For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com. A 'frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease' has been described in patients with predominant behavioural or dysexecutive deficits caused by Alzheimer's disease pathology. The description of this rare Alzheimer's disease phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural Alzheimer's disease) and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood Alzheimer's disease (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined Alzheimer's disease with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease). We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 53{\%}; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 83{\%}) than behavioural (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 25{\%}; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 3{\%}). Apathy was the most common behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease was modest (9/75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease and 40{\%} of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE $\epsilon$4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) Alzheimer's disease (typical Alzheimer's disease, n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical Alzheimer's disease, while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical Alzheimer's disease. Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical Alzheimer's disease were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P {\textless} 0.001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural Alzheimer's disease/dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural Alzheimer's disease presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE $\epsilon$4 prevalence. Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE $\epsilon$4 prevalence. Both behavioural Alzheimer's disease and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease' rather than frontal variant Alzheimer's disease. Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of Alzheimer's disease represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Alzheimer's disease (AD) can present with distinct clinical variants. Identifying the earliest neurodegenerative changes associated with each variant has implications for early diagnosis, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie regional vulnerability and disease progression in AD. We performed voxel-based morphometry to detect atrophy patterns in early clinical stages of four AD phenotypes: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, "visual variant," n = 93), logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA, "language variant," n = 74), and memory-predominant AD categorized as early age-of-onset (EOAD, {\textless}65 years, n = 114) and late age-of-onset (LOAD, {\textgreater}65 years, n = 114). Patients with each syndrome were stratified based on: (1) degree of functional impairment, as measured by the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale, and (2) overall extent of brain atrophy, as measured by a neuroimaging approach that sums the number of brain voxels showing significantly lower gray matter volume than cognitively normal controls (n = 80). Even at the earliest clinical stage (CDR=0.5 or bottom quartile of overall atrophy), patients with each syndrome showed both common and variant-specific atrophy. Common atrophy across variants was found in temporoparietal regions that comprise the posterior default mode network (DMN). Early syndrome-specific atrophy mirrored functional brain networks underlying functions that are uniquely affected in each variant: Language network in lvPPA, posterior cingulate cortex-hippocampal circuit in amnestic EOAD and LOAD, and visual networks in PCA. At more advanced stages, atrophy patterns largely converged across AD variants. These findings support a model in which neurodegeneration selectively targets both the DMN and syndrome-specific vulnerable networks at the earliest clinical stages of AD.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved. Recruitment of extra neural resources may allow people to maintain normal cognition despite amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques. Previous fMRI studies have reported such hyperactivation, but it is unclear whether increases represent compensation or aberrant overexcitation. We found that older adults with A$\beta$ deposition had reduced deactivations in task-negative regions, but increased activation in task-positive regions related to more detailed memory encoding. The association between higher activity and more detailed memories suggests that A$\beta$-related hyperactivation is compensatory.},

@article{Wirth2014,
abstract = {This study used path analysis to examine effects of cognitive activity and physical activity on cognitive functioning in older adults, through pathways involving beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) burden, cerebrovascular lesions, and neural injury within the brain regions affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ninety-two cognitively normal older adults (75.2 ± 5.6years) reported lifetime cognitive activity and current physical activity using validated questionnaires. For each participant, we evaluated cortical A$\beta$ burden (using [11C] labeled Pittsburgh-Compound-B positron emission tomography), cerebrovascular lesions (using magnetic resonance imaging-defined white matter lesion [WML]), and neural integrity within AD regions (using a multimodal neuroimaging biomarker). Path models (adjusted for age, gender, and education) indicated that higher lifetime cognitive activity and higher current physical activity was associated with fewer WMLs. Lower WML volumes were in turn related to higher neural integrity and higher global cognitive functioning. As shown previously, higher lifetime cognitive activity was associated with lower [11C] labeled Pittsburgh-Compound-B retention, which itself moderated the impact of neural integrity on cognitive functioning. Lifestyle activity may thus promote cognitive health in aging by protecting against cerebrovascular pathology and A$\beta$ pathology thought to be relevant to AD development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},
